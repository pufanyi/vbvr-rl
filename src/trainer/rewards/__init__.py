"""Reward-function package for Flow-GRPO training.

To add a new reward:
    1. Write a ``BaseReward`` subclass in a new module under this package and
       decorate it with ``@register_reward("your_name")``.
    2. Import the module below so the decorator fires at package-import time.
    3. Set ``grpo_reward_fn: your_name`` in the training YAML.
